# Solar-System

You can see the results in both the DOM and the console.

## Objectives

I used various methods on the planet array. Requirements were the forEach, map, filter, and reduce method. I also used several other methods in these exercises, such as join, include, and charAt methods.

I tried some jQuery and ES6 in a couple of places.
